# Axis_1_4__Java21
Axis 1.4 modified to work in Java 21 / Tomcat 10+

With many javax shit moved to jakarta it's imposible to update Java / Tomcat for your old Axis 1.4 based application. Now it is possible, just use this modified version. If it ain't broken don't fix it, you can keep your application running and doing a good job with this. Included full eclipse projects from my Workspace, I'm sure you'll know what to do with them. All you need is in Axis_1_4_Blank - it contains 2 modified jars. You can look at the modifications in the other two projects.
